# AcrylicLights
The JSA/VSA Collaboration for Edge-Lit LED Acrylic Signs

## About
This project was created by Jake Uyechi and Khoa Van (c/o 2023) as a gift for the Japanese Student Association and the Vietnamese Student Associations at the University of Portland.

## Components
The components for each of the parts in this project are included in separate folders.

3D Print Components - the 3D printed plastic bases to hold the LED strips and the acrylic sheets. These contain the necessary STL files for the multi-piece plastic bases.

Arduino Sketch - the Arduino code for the Arduino Nano that was used in this project.

JSA Acrylic Panels - contains the SVG files for the acrylic panels for the JSA logo and side panels.

PCB Gerber (4 LED Strips).zip - a .zip file containing Gerber files for custom PCB manufacturing. This particular PCB Gerber file uses a single Arduino Nano to control 4 individual WS2812B LED strips. Had there been more time for development on this project, a 5-strip design would have been more efficient, as a single Arduino Nano would be able to drive all the LED strips in the final product.
